# Session Compounding Workflow

> Converts session learnings into durable improvements.

## Methodology Context

This workflow implements the **Compound** step of the Organon enforcement loop. Without explicit compounding, improvement never happens — session learnings are lost between contexts. This workflow detects patterns, classifies improvements, and executes the highest-priority one. For methodology background, read `organon/PRIMER.md`.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- **Ending a significant work session** — substantial changes were made
- **After completing a multi-step task** — new patterns may have emerged
- **After encountering friction** — something was harder than it should have been

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Review Session Work

    git diff --stat HEAD~N  # N = commits in this session
    git log --oneline -N

List files created/modified, types of changes, and patterns in the work.

### Step 2: Detect Patterns

| Signal | Example | Indicates |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Repeated manual steps** | Same 3 commands every time | Tool candidate |
| **Unclear workflow** | Wasn't sure which skill to use | Workflow gap |
| **New heuristic** | Same decision made repeatedly | Heuristic addition |
| **Awkward tool usage** | Same command 3 different ways | Tool improvement |
| **Missing context** | Needed 5 files, skill listed 3 | Workflow context update |
| **Error without guidance** | Tool failed, didn't know fix | Error recovery addition |

### Step 3: Classify Improvements

| Category | Where to Implement |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Tool candidate** | `packages/tools/` — new command or flag |
| **Protocol update** | `organon/protocols/PROTOCOLS.md` |
| **Heuristic addition** | `CLAUDE.md` or `organon/ETHOS.md` |
| **Workflow refinement** | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

### Step 4: Prioritize

    Priority = How often does this recur? x How much friction does it cause?

| Frequency | Impact | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Every session | Blocks work | Highest — do now |
| Weekly | Slows work | High — do this session |
| Monthly | Annoying | Medium — create RFC |
| Rare | Minor | Low — note for future |

### Step 5: Execute Improvement

With user confirmation, implement the highest-priority improvement.

### Step 6: Run Verification

    organon verify
    organon health

Confirm no regressions.

### Step 7: Record Observations (Optional)

If the session produced observations worth preserving:
- An active observation file covers this topic → add to it
- No relevant file → create new `organon/observations/NNN-descriptive-name.md`

Each observation needs: Signal (what happened), Implication (what it means), Suggested Action (what to do).

**Not every session produces observations — that's fine.**

---

## Verification

- [ ] At least one improvement identified and classified
- [ ] Highest-priority improvement either executed or documented
- [ ] `organon verify` passes after any changes
- [ ] `organon health` score has not decreased

---

## Error Recovery

| Failure | Recovery Action |
|---------|-----------------|
| No patterns detected | Session may have been too small. Note for next session. |
| Improvement breaks verification | Revert. Re-analyze the approach. |
| User declines execution | Document as TODO or RFC for future. |
| Too many improvements | Execute only highest-priority. Document the rest. |
