# Verify and Health Workflow

> Daily-use verification and health check for project integrity.

## Methodology Context

This workflow implements the **Verify** step of the Organon enforcement loop. Verification runs 9 automated gates (frontmatter, triplets, references, placeholders, freshness, invariant coverage, workflow quality, tier4 tests, version alignment) that close the gap between documented constraints and actual project state. For methodology background, read `organon/PRIMER.md`.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- **Starting a work session** — baseline integrity check
- **Before committing changes** — ensure nothing is broken
- **After significant edits** — verify no regressions

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Run All Verification Gates

    organon verify

This runs all gates:
- **frontmatter** — YAML frontmatter present, valid, and truthful
- **triplets** — Protocol↔workflow bindings are bidirectional
- **references** — `inherits_from`, `loads:`, `protocol_file` paths resolve
- **placeholder-detection** — Template placeholders like `[Describe...]` detected (advisory)
- **freshness** — Files reviewed within threshold (advisory)
- **invariant-coverage** — Invariants tracked in tests
- **workflow-quality** — Workflows have protocol_id, tools, loads, error recovery
- **tier4-tests** — Test files use @organon-invariant annotations
- **version-alignment** — Config methodology_version matches CLI version (advisory)

### Step 2: Run Health Check

    organon health

Reports overall project health score.

### Step 3: Interpret Failures

| Gate | Common Failure | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| frontmatter | Missing field | Add field per frontmatter schema |
| frontmatter | Count mismatch | Update counts to match content |
| frontmatter | Token estimate off | Recalculate (~12 tokens/line) |
| triplets | Orphaned workflow | Add `protocol_id` to workflow frontmatter |
| triplets | Phantom automation | Create workflow or change protocol to manual |
| invariant-coverage | Invariant without test | Create tier-4 test for the invariant |
| workflow-quality | Missing protocol_id | Add `protocol_id: PROTO-SCOPE-N` |
| workflow-quality | Missing error recovery | Add `## Error Recovery` section |
| tier4-tests | Missing annotation | Add `@organon-invariant INV-*` to test |
| references | Broken inherits_from | Fix `inherits_from` to reference existing organon names |
| references | Broken loads path | Fix file path in workflow `loads:` array |
| placeholder-detection | Uncustomized template | Replace `[Describe...]` placeholders with real content |
| version-alignment | Methodology drift | Update `methodology_version` in config to match CLI |

### Step 4: Apply Fixes

For each failure: identify file and field, apply fix, reference specification.

### Step 5: Re-verify

    organon verify && organon health

All gates should pass. Health score should be equal or higher.

---

## Verification

- [ ] All gates pass (`organon verify` exits 0)
- [ ] Health score reported
- [ ] No regressions from previous health score

---

## Error Recovery

| Failure | Recovery Action |
|---------|-----------------|
| `organon verify` not found | Build: `cd packages/tools && npm install && npm run build` |
| Fix introduces new failure | Re-run full verify. Fix cascading issues in order: frontmatter → triplets → workflow-quality. |
| Health score decreased | Investigate what changed. Usually means file removed or frontmatter invalidated. |
| Too many failures | Prioritize: frontmatter first (others depend on it), then triplets, then rest. |
