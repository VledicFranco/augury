# Project Ethos

> Behavioral constraints for agents working on this project. Edit this file to define your product's identity and rules.

---

## Identity

### What This Project IS

- [Describe what your project does — be specific]
- [What problem does it solve?]
- [What technology does it use?]

### What This Project IS NOT

- [What does it explicitly NOT do?]
- [What is out of scope?]
- [What should developers NOT build here?]

---

## Invariants

1. **[Invariant name].** [Describe a hard constraint that must always hold. What breaks if this is violated?]

2. **[Invariant name].** [Another constraint. Each invariant should be testable and enforceable.]

3. **[Invariant name].** [A third constraint. Enforced by: specify how (tests, gates, reviews).]

---

## Principles (Prioritized)

1. **[Priority 1] over [alternative].** [One-line explanation. This wins when principles conflict.]

2. **[Priority 2] over [alternative].** [Second priority. Yields to principle 1 in conflicts.]

3. **[Priority 3] over [alternative].** [Third priority.]
