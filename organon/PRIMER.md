# Organon Methodology Primer

> Read this on your first session with this project. It gives you enough understanding of the Organon methodology to work effectively.

---

## What Organon Is

Organon is a **behavioral constraint system for human-LLM collaboration**. It defines project constraints, design rationale, and procedures in standardized files that LLM agents can parse, enforce, and evolve. It is not documentation — it is machine-executable governance.

---

## The 3 Artifact Types

| Artifact | Purpose | Contains | Required? |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **ETHOS.md** | Constraints — what MUST be true | Identity (IS/IS NOT), invariants, prioritized principles, decision heuristics | Yes |
| **PHILOSOPHY.md** | Rationale — why decisions were made | Problem, the bet, design decisions, trade-offs, alternatives | Optional |
| **PROTOCOL.md** | Procedures — how to do things | Goal, preconditions, numbered steps, verification, error recovery | Optional |

Never mix concerns: constraints go in ETHOS, reasoning in PHILOSOPHY, procedures in PROTOCOL.

---

## The Enforcement Loop

Organon works because constraints are enforced, not just documented:

    Define (organon) → Bind (workflow) → Execute (tools) → Verify (gates) → Compound (improve) → Evolve (update organon)

- **Protocols** define what must happen (knowledge layer)
- **Workflows** bind protocols to agent capabilities (e.g., Claude skills, Cursor rules)
- **Tools** execute atomic operations the workflow orchestrates (e.g., `organon verify`)
- **Verification** closes the loop — automated gates check that constraints hold

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Every organon file has YAML **frontmatter** (~25-50 tokens) that lets agents decide whether to load the full file:

    Layer 0: README-as-Router   → "What files exist?"
    Layer 1: Frontmatter         → "Should I load this file?" (type, scope, summary, token_estimate)
    Layer 2: Section Headings    → "What sections does it have?"
    Layer 3: Specific Section    → "Load just ## Invariants"
    Layer 4: Full File           → "Load everything"

Never load what you don't need. Use frontmatter to filter first.

---

## Frontmatter Essentials

Every organon file requires these fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `type` | File category | navigation, constraints, rationale, procedures, mapping |
| `scope` | Hierarchy level | product, domain, feature, component, meta, methodology |
| `name` | Unique kebab-case ID | `auth-domain`, `billing-feature` |
| `version` | Semantic version | `"1.0"` |
| `summary` | One-line description | Max 200 chars |
| `token_estimate` | Loading cost | ~12 tokens/line |

---

## Scope Inheritance

    Product → Domain → Feature → Component

- **Child inherits ALL parent constraints** — can add, never contradict
- **Domain** = bounded context with ≥3 unique concepts ("What business concepts exist?")
- **Feature** = cross-cutting capability ("What can users do?")
- **Component** = code module ("Where is the code?")

---

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `organon verify` | Run all verification gates (frontmatter, triplets, references, etc.) |
| `organon health` | Aggregate project integrity score (0-100) |
| `organon validate <path>` | Validate a single file's frontmatter and structure |
| `organon generate <path>` | Generate frontmatter for an existing file |
| `organon find` | Query organon files by name, scope, or type |
| `organon query` | Query frontmatter fields across all organon files |
| `organon coverage` | Report invariant test coverage |
| `organon generate-tests` | Generate test scaffolds for uncovered invariants |
| `organon suggest` | Suggest tools and workflows for a task |
| `organon release <bump>` | Bump version, tag, and create GitHub release |

---

## Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Phantom enforcement | Invariant claims enforcement but mechanism doesn't exist | Add real gate or tool |
| Aspiration as invariant | "Should be high quality" | Rewrite as testable constraint |
| Missing frontmatter | File has no YAML header | Add frontmatter (breaks progressive disclosure without it) |
| Context overload | Workflow loads >10 files | Reduce to essential files |
| Deferred organon | "We'll write ETHOS later" | Write ETHOS before implementing |
