## Frontmatter Schema

### Required Fields (all files)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | enum | `navigation` \| `constraints` \| `rationale` \| `procedures` \| `mapping` |
| `scope` | enum | `product` \| `domain` \| `feature` \| `component` \| `meta` \| `methodology` |

| `summary` | string | One-sentence description, max 200 characters |
| `token_estimate` | number | Approximate token cost (~12 tokens/line) |

### Type-Specific Fields

| Type | Additional Fields |
|------|-------------------|
| `constraints` (ETHOS) | `invariants_count`, `principles_count`, `heuristics_count` |
| `rationale` (PHILOSOPHY) | `decision_count` |
| `procedures` (PROTOCOL) | `protocols` array with `id`, `name`, `automation_tier`, `tools`, `workflow` |
| `navigation` (README) | `provides` array |
| `mapping` | `component_count` or similar |

| `related_features` | Features this file relates to |
| `primary_rfcs` | RFCs that created this artifact |
| `load_priority` | `high` \| `medium` \| `low` — agent loading guidance |

## Scope Hierarchy

### Definitions

| Scope | Question Answered | When to Use |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Product** | "What is this project?" | Repo-wide constraints, one per project |
| **Domain** | "What business concepts exist?" | Bounded context with ≥3 unique concepts + lifecycle |
| **Feature** | "What can users do?" | Cross-cutting capability spanning domains |
| **Component** | "Where is the code?" | Code module with dependency relationships |
| **Meta** | "What are the rules for organons?" | Meta-organon (organon about organons) |
| **Methodology** | "How do we build?" | Process documentation, separate from product |

### Inheritance Rules

1. Child inherits ALL parent constraints — never contradicts
2. More specific scope wins on ambiguity
3. Child can add constraints, not relax them
4. Always load product ethos first, then domain, then feature

### Decision Heuristic

- Has ≥3 unique concepts + own lifecycle → **Domain**
- Crosses multiple domains → **Feature**
- Describes code structure → **Component**
- Describes process (how to build) → **Methodology**

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layers

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Protocols** | What must happen (knowledge) | "Verify frontmatter before committing" |
| **Workflows** | How to orchestrate (agent bindings) | Claude skill, Cursor rule, CI pipeline |
| **Tools** | How to execute (atomic operations) | `organon verify`, `organon validate` |

### Automation Tiers

| Tier | When | What to Create |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Automated** | ≥5 steps, cross-domain, error-prone, frequent | Protocol + Workflow + Tools |
| **Semi-automated** | 1-2 steps, single tool | Protocol + Tool only |
| **Manual** | Judgment required, rare | Protocol only |

### Bidirectional References (Hard Invariant)

When a protocol declares `automation_tier: automated`:
- Protocol MUST list `workflow: <workflow-name>`
- Workflow MUST have `protocol_id: <PROTO-ID>` and `protocol_file: <path>` in frontmatter
- Verified by `organon verify --gate triplets`

---

## Verification Gates

| Gate | Blocking? | What It Checks |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `frontmatter` | Yes | YAML present, valid, counts match content |
| `triplets` | Yes | Protocol↔workflow bindings are bidirectional |
| `references` | Yes | `inherits_from`, `loads:`, `protocol_file` resolve |
| `placeholder-detection` | No | Template placeholders like `[Describe...]` remain |
| `freshness` | No | Files reviewed within configured threshold |
| `invariant-coverage` | Yes | Every non-judgment invariant has ≥1 test |
| `workflow-quality` | Yes | Workflows have protocol_id, tools, loads, error recovery |
| `tier4-tests` | No | Test files use `@organon-invariant` annotations |
| `version-alignment` | No | Config methodology_version matches CLI version |

### Common Diagnostic Codes

| Code | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `FRONTMATTER_MISSING` | Add YAML frontmatter (use `organon generate`) |
| `FRONTMATTER_COUNT_MISMATCH` | Update count fields to match content |
| `TRIPLET_ORPHANED_WORKFLOW` | Add `protocol_id` to workflow frontmatter |
| `TRIPLET_PHANTOM_AUTOMATION` | Create workflow or change protocol to manual |
| `REFERENCE_BROKEN_INHERIT` | Fix `inherits_from` to reference existing names |
| `REFERENCE_BROKEN_LOADS` | Fix path in workflow `loads:` array |
| `WORKFLOW_MISSING_PROTOCOL_ID` | Add `protocol_id: PROTO-SCOPE-N` |
| `WORKFLOW_MISSING_TOOLS` | Add `tools:` array to workflow frontmatter |
| `WORKFLOW_NO_ERROR_RECOVERY` | Add `## Error Recovery` section |
| `PLACEHOLDER_DETECTED` | Replace template placeholders with real content |

---

## Invariant Tracking

### Invariant ID Format

    INV-{SCOPE}-{N}    (e.g., INV-AUTH-1, INV-TOOLS-3)

- IDs are declared in ETHOS.md `invariants` frontmatter array
- IDs are never reused — retired IDs leave gaps

### Test-to-Invariant Binding

Tests reference invariant IDs via annotations:

    // @organon-invariant INV-AUTH-1
    test('passwords must be hashed', () => { ... });

The `organon coverage` command scans test files for `@organon-invariant` annotations and reports which invariants have tests.

### Judgment-Call Invariants

Mark invariants that cannot be automated with `judgment_call: true` in frontmatter. These are excluded from automated coverage checks and reviewed via PR reviews.

---

## Workflow Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Completeness** | All protocol steps have workflow steps or documented skip-with-rationale |
| **Traceability** | Bidirectional protocol↔workflow binding via frontmatter |
| **Context sufficiency** | `loads:` array lists all required organon files |
| **Error recoverability** | `## Error Recovery` section with failure/recovery table |
| **Idempotency awareness** | Each tool annotated as idempotent or not |
| **Scope alignment** | Workflow scope matches protocol scope |

### Workflow Archetypes

| Archetype | Characteristics |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Verification** | Idempotent, pass/fail checks (e.g., verify-and-health) |
| **Generation** | Creates artifacts, idempotent output (e.g., organon-file-creation) |
| **Implementation** | Non-idempotent phases, longest (e.g., domain-feature-design) |
| **Migration** | Batch transform, partial success OK |
| **Diagnostic** | Read-only, advisory (e.g., session-compounding) |

### Error Handling Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fail-Fast Gate** | Stop if step fails, remaining steps meaningless |
| **Accumulate-and-Report** | Run all steps, aggregate errors at end |
| **Checkpoint-and-Resume** | Save after each phase, resume from last success |

---

## Key Patterns

### Ethos-First Development

Write ETHOS.md before implementing. Define constraints, then build to satisfy them.

### RFC-Driven Evolution

    Organon ("should be") ←cites→ RFC ("will be") →implements→ Code ("what is")

RFCs declare organon impact upfront. Organon changes land in the same PR as implementation.

### Recursive Collaboration

    PLAN (10-20%) → WORK (60-70%) → REVIEW (10-20%) → COMPOUND (5-10%)

The COMPOUND phase is where methodology improves. Without explicit time allocation, improvement never happens.

### Context Loading Strategy

1. Always load product ETHOS first (foundational)
2. Use frontmatter to filter — check `scope`, `required_for`, `token_estimate`
3. Load domain/feature ETHOS on-demand when entering that scope
4. Reserve 8-15K tokens for organon context in your budget

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Phantom enforcement | Invariant says "enforced by X" but X doesn't exist | Create the enforcement mechanism |
| Aspiration as invariant | "Should be" language in invariant | Rewrite as "must be" with gate |
| Context overload | Workflow loads >10 files | Reduce to essential files only |
| Missing error recovery | No failure/recovery table in workflow | Add `## Error Recovery` section |
| Scope creep | IS NOT section doesn't define boundaries | Add specific IS NOT statements |
| Open enforcement loop | Protocol exists but no workflow or tool | Close the loop or change tier to manual |
| Deferred organon | "We'll write ETHOS later" | Write ETHOS before implementing |
| Unprioritized principles | Principles listed without ordering | Number by priority (lower = higher) |
| File splitting for size | Files split just because they're long | Use progressive disclosure instead |
| Protocol drift | Workflow steps don't match protocol | Sync workflow with protocol |
