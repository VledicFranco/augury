# Development Protocols

> Step-by-step procedures for development activities. Each protocol has a corresponding workflow (skill) binding.

## Protocol Overview

| ID | Name | Workflow | Complexity |
|----|------|----------|------------|
| PROTO-ORG-1 | RFC-Driven Design | domain-feature-design | High |
| PROTO-ORG-4 | Verification and Health | verify-and-health | Low |
| PROTO-ORG-5 | Session Compounding | session-compounding | Medium |
| PROTO-ORG-6 | Organon File Creation | organon-file-creation | Medium |
| PROTO-ORG-7 | Quality Review | quality-review | High |

## PROTO-ORG-1: RFC-Driven Design

> Design new domains and features using RFC-Driven Evolution.

### Goal

Produce a complete RFC with both organon mutation plan and technical implementation plan.

### Steps

1. **Load context.** Read organon/ETHOS.md and CLAUDE.md.
2. **Classify scope.** Domain (bounded context), feature (cross-cutting), or component.
3. **Create RFC.** Determine next number, create rfcs/NNN-name.md.
4. **Write organon plan.** Exact ETHOS.md and PHILOSOPHY.md content.
5. **Write technical plan.** Architecture, API, implementation phases.
6. **Self-review.** Both plans present, invariants testable, principles prioritized.

### Verification

- [ ] RFC has both organon and technical plans
- [ ] Invariants are testable
- [ ] `organon validate` passes on RFC

---

## PROTO-ORG-4: Verification and Health

> Run all verification gates and health checks.

### Goal

Confirm project integrity with actionable fix guidance.

### Steps

1. **Run verification.** `organon verify` (all gates).
2. **Run health.** `organon health` for overall score.
3. **Interpret failures.** Map each to specific fix.
4. **Apply fixes.** Edit specific files and fields.
5. **Re-verify.** Confirm all gates pass.

### Verification

- [ ] All gates pass
- [ ] Health score reported

---

## PROTO-ORG-5: Session Compounding

> Review session output, detect patterns, execute improvements.

### Goal

Convert session learnings into durable improvements.

### Steps

1. **Review session.** Examine git diff of changes.
2. **Detect patterns.** Look for repeated steps, unclear workflows, new heuristics.
3. **Classify.** Tool candidate, protocol update, heuristic addition, or workflow refinement.
4. **Prioritize.** Frequency x impact.
5. **Execute.** Implement highest-priority improvement.
6. **Verify.** `organon verify` and `organon health`.
7. **Record observations.** If session revealed lasting insights.

### Verification

- [ ] At least one improvement identified
- [ ] `organon verify` passes

---

## PROTO-ORG-6: Organon File Creation

> Create valid organon files with correct placement and references.

### Goal

Produce a valid organon file with proper frontmatter, structure, and inheritance.

### Steps

1. **Classify scope.** Product, domain, feature, or component.
2. **Check parent.** Load parent ETHOS.md, new file must inherit constraints.
3. **Select template.** ETHOS, PHILOSOPHY, PROTOCOL, or README.
4. **Determine placement.** Under organon/domains/ or organon/features/.
5. **Generate frontmatter.** Type, scope, name, version, summary, token_estimate.
6. **Write content.** Follow template section structure.
7. **Validate.** `organon validate` on new file.
8. **Check references.** `organon verify --gate triplets` for bidirectional refs.

### Verification

- [ ] `organon validate` passes
- [ ] File in correct directory
- [ ] Parent constraints inherited

---

## PROTO-ORG-7: Quality Review

> Semantic review beyond automated gates.

### Goal

Find quality issues automation can't detect: vague invariants, misordered principles, inconsistent terminology.

### Steps

1. **Run automated gates.** `organon verify` and `organon validate`.
2. **Review invariants.** Testable? Specific? Enforceable?
3. **Review principles.** Genuinely prioritized? Conflict test passes?
4. **Review identity.** Specific and distinguishing?
5. **Review heuristics.** Cover actual recurring decisions?
6. **Check anti-patterns.** Phantom enforcement, aspiration as invariant, etc.
7. **Generate report.** Findings by severity with fix recommendations.

### Verification

- [ ] All automated gates pass
- [ ] Every invariant passes "testable?" filter
- [ ] No anti-pattern matches
